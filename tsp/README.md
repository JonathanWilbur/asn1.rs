# Timestamp Protocol (TSP)

ASN.1 data structures based on the ASN.1 definitions in
[IETF RFC 3161](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3161.txt),
which defines the Timestamp Protocol (TSP).

These libraries were generated entirely or in part by the
[ASN.1 Compilation Service](https://wildboarsoftware.com/asn1-compilation)
offered by [Wildboar Software](https://wildboarsoftware.com). The ASN.1
compiler itself is closed-source and proprietary, but some of the libraries
produced with it are released publicly under the
[MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).

If you would like to see additional ASN.1 libraries in Rust or other
programming languages, or if you have any other questions, please contact us at
[contact@wildboarsoftware.com](mailto:contact@wildboarsoftware.com).
