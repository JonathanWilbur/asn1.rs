# Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ASN.1) Library

This library contains types and functions for using ASN.1 values. This library
does NOT have anything to do with encoding or decoding such values according to
the Basic, Canonical, Distinguished, Packed, Octet, XML, JSON, General String,
or BACNet Encoding Rules. This library is purposely abstracted from any
particular encoding so that ASN.1 values can be translated between different
encodings.
